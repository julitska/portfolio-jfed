My Portfolio

This project showcases my ability to build a clean, responsive portfolio using React and styled-components.
The layout is designed to highlight my projects with clarity, using minimalist design choices
which I hope reflects my personality.

I build my portfolio page by focusing on reusable components, semantic structure, and responsive styling.
I practiced dynamic rendering with JSX, refined my use of props and layout composition.

This build helped me strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, component hierarchy, 
and the importance of intentional design that reflects both personality and usability.
